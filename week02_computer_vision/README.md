# 🖼️ Week 2: Computer Vision

A simple web application using Flask and YOLOv8 to detect objects in uploaded images. The processed image will display bounding boxes around detected objects.

## Features

- Upload an image via a web interface
- Detect objects using YOLOv8
- Show processed image with bounding boxes
- Automatically cleans up old files to save space

## Requirements

- Python 3.11.2
- See `requirements.txt` for all dependencies

Install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
